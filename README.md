Overview
Data science and predictive models have profoundly impacted many industries, particularly finance. Credit bureaus, banks, and other money-lending institutions have developed credit scoring models to assess the creditworthiness of individuals.

Credit Scoring Models
Credit scoring models evaluate an individual's profile by analyzing factors such as payment history, number of accounts, types of credit, and other financial data, combined with demographic information, to generate a credit score. This score is then used by lending firms to decide whether it is safe to extend credit to an applicant.

1. Importing Datasets
We begin by importing essential libraries and historical data to set the foundation for our analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is critical for understanding the data and preparing it for modeling. It includes checking the dataset's structure, identifying missing values, and performing basic statistical analysis.

Key Insights:

The dataset contains 125,000 rows and 28 columns.
Missing values are present, and data types need correction.
Some columns, like Age, contain anomalies.
3. Data Preprocessing
This step involves cleaning and preparing the data for model building by handling missing values, correcting data types, capping outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

3.1 Missing Value Imputation and Typecasting:
We created a function to handle missing values and incorrect data types by grouping data by Customer_ID and using the mode for imputation.

3.2 Outlier Capping:
Outliers are identified and capped using the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) method.

3.3 Visualization:
We perform advanced EDA through histograms, correlation matrices, and bar charts to understand the distribution and interactions within the data.

3.4 Encoding:
Categorical variables are converted to numerical representations using label encoding and one-hot encoding.

3.5 Feature Reduction:
Unimportant features are dropped, and important ones are selected using methods like Random Forest, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Univariate Analysis.

3.6 Checking Multicollinearity:
Highly correlated features are identified and removed using correlation matrices and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to ensure model stability.

3.7 Scaling Data:
Independent features are normalized using the min-max scaler method.

4. Balancing Data
Given the imbalance in the target variable, techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using algorithms that handle imbalance are applied to ensure a robust model.

This structured approach ensures the data is clean, relevant, and ready for building a reliable credit score model.
